# Investigate a Dataset Project

This is a **Python**-based project, completed in terms of the requirements of
**Udacity's** _Data Analyst_ nanodegree program. This repo contains the written
report created for this project, as well as the jupyter notebook (in HTML format)
used for the data analysis process while completing this project.

## Project Overview

For this project, I had to select 1 dataset from a possible 5 from Udacity's
dataset collection, and perform the entire data analysis process on the chosen
dataset. I had to record all my work and analytical steps both in a jupyter
notebook and an optional written report.

The data analysis process involved using **Python**, as well as additional libraries
such as **NumPy**, **pandas**, **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
